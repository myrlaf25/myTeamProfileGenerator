## Description

Link to my Team Profile Generator video: https://vimeo.com/528570435/8fe92a9582 

My goal is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team. 
This application was built to make it easier for the user to generate an HTML webpage that will display summaries for each employee. 
This is a command-line application that accepts user input when prompted for information pertaining to each team member and their information. An HTML file is then generated which will display the information based on user input. On the browser, the user will be able to click on the email link or the github account. The application will include information such as the team member roles of engineer, manager, or intern. Also, it will include name, email, ID, Github, Office Number, and School. The user will be prompt once he enters the information for the first employee, if the user would like to add another team member. If the user adds another team member, it will prompt the list of questions. If the user has completed the entries and will not be adding another team member, the app will then generate the HTML.
